<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
During the days 19 and 20 of february/2016 there will be a tecnoshamanism meeting in Berlin! This meeting intends to gather people that are interested in the intersection between DIY technologies and ancestor futuristic knowledge.<br
/><br
/>By "ancestor futuristic knowledge" we understand the approximation of ancestral knowledge, cosmovisions, alchemy, shamanisms, magic,&nbsp; free cosmogonies with foresight technologies and possible futurologies.<br
/><br
/>If rationalism and individualism somehow exhaust a way to produce an ecologically and socially balanced existence, and if the Earth presents emergencies that the anthropocentrism can't take care of, what can we do to reach other relations of states between human / nature / cosmos?<br
/><br
/>All this discussion about interspecifcs, subjectivity of matter, anthropocene, and theoretical speculative discussions is something that moves us / touches, or is it just the latest intellectual agenda in international meetings, which soon will sound as obsolete concepts?<br
/><br
/>You can approach if you feel called by the junction of these terms (techno + shamanism, ancestrality + futurism). You can come to the workshops, discussions and rituals that will be made during the whole weekend in free radio format, with free expression and listening space for many different backgrounds.

<h4>TECHNOSHAMANISM NETWORK</h4>
Tecnoshamanism has been configured as a cross-border network that gathers people interested in thinking their ideas and everyday actions at the same time they thinking open science, open technology and open cosmological and ecosophical visions. Putting in doubt the technology development projects also has been an issue; we want above all to rescue the spirit of hacklabs, which in many cases have lost their collaborative and adventurer spirit in favor of an the entrepreneurial culture.<br
/><br
/>Over these last few years we have made a series of meetings, events, festivals and practical constructions to think/act in relation to all this. We made meetings in Spain, England, Denmark, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil and now we are organizing this meeting in Berlin. Every city/country has its characteristics, its way of dealing with these issues, its singular reading about all these processes and its own conjectures about ancestrality/futurism. So what we leave is always a question, instead of coming with programs and reports...<br
/><br
/>If tecnoshamanism presents itself as an aesthetic tendency with its rituals, immersive processes, internarratives and live fictionalizations, it also appears as a set of practices that are carried out by its collaborators. In this category come forest garden projects, reconstructing river sources, defence of indigenous areas and populations, renewable energy projects, intranet networks, etc.<br

/><b>2 - Refugies Territories - Quilombos</b> 18:00<br
/><br
/>Carsten Agger (Denmark) - Baobáxia - an internet between quilombos - a community organized effort to preserve the cultural heritage of rural, often off-line and very dispersed Afro-Brazilian communities - and to liberate digital cultural work from the behemoths of Google and Facebook<br

/>Peggy Sylopp (German) - A community of changemakers seeks to create a collaborative workspace for all who are developing innovative solutions linked to the social challenge of migration<br
/><a href="http://www.migrationhub.eu/">http://www.migrationhub.eu/</a><br
/><br
/><b>3 - TELEMATIC EXPERIENCE</b> 20:00 in Berlim / 17:00 in Brazil<br
/><br
/>NANO - Nucleus of Art and New Organisms - works with&nbsp; technological tools, combined with handmade objects, exploring the creative potential that results from the integration of artificial, digital and / or analog systems, with natural organisms.<br
/><br
/>Proposition: we here propose a telematic experience within the project S.H.A.S.T. (Housing System for Homeless Bees) which investigates poetic intersections between art, nature, and technology in the context of telematics, in this case involving a swarm of africanized bees, located in the municipality of Vargem Alegre, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, NANO Lab's server and anyone who desires to apply the date sent from the hive in their own work or interactive system. We wish to promote, through the construction of these hybrid objects and their facilities, experiences that can provide a poetic, sensory and intuitive perception of possible integration between species, between beings, between organisms. In our view, this semantic intersection is made possible by the emergence of a aesthesis re-invented by hybrid organisms which allow the establishment of codes of communication between different systems, always starting from an artistic proposition.<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/><b>4 - PREPARATION FOR THE RITUAL</b> 21:00<br
/><br
/>All people who are already involved in the ritual or who want to work with us, have to come for this meeting!! Here we will brainstorm and organize the ritual for Saturday!!
<br><br>
<h4><u>SATURDAY 19/02</u></h4>

<b>1 - DIY WORKSHOPS:&nbsp;</b><br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;A) 15:00 - Demonstration/workshop - Dissolution with Martin Howse&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;Description: Dissolution literally describes an earth-technological cycle of mineral extraction (copper, gold and silver are mined from the earth to create technology) and return (junked technology is half-heartedly dissolved back into the earth). Dissolution returns to the beginnings of Western chemistry in alchemy, utilizing historical electro-chemical processes to return technology to the earth, to complete and mock these (natural) cycles.<br
/><br
/>In this instance of an ongoing research, participants are invited to dissolve personal technologies (please bring) under an angelic breath of pure noise.<br
/><br
/><br
/><b>2 - FREE RADIO (DEBATES with public):</b><br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>A) Animism, matter and subjectivity - 16:00<br
/><br
/>- Erick Felinto (Brazil) - Philosophical Fiction, Science fiction, Fiction and interfiction, Superstition and&nbsp; hyperstition. Creativity and the Encounter with Radical Otherness.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>- Martin Howse (UK and Germany) -&nbsp;&nbsp; links between the earth (geophysical phenomena), software and the human psyche (psychogeophysics), proposing a return to animism within a critical misuse of scientific technology.<br
/><br
/>B) Open Ports - 18:00<br
/><br
/>Oliver Lerone Schultz (Full Spectrum Analyst at GPA) and Kei Kreutler (Classification Specialist at GPA) are introducing some of the history, motivations and horizons of of the Global Ports Authority, especially focussing on it´s current re-construction concomitant to the 7th planetary Global Port Process (GPG7).<br
/>- Within the context of this workshop the GPA is mirthful for a chance to insert and unearth some of GPA´s millenial history and polit-mythology as relevant to the global port system. A special focus will be docking the GPA-story to techno-shamanism. Also we will try to collect and bind some relevant Tempelhof-histories to all this. The workshop will also be an opportunity to talk about missing (or lost) chapters of the GPA. <br
/><a href="http://www.gpaworldports.org">http://www.gpaworldports.org</a> (see particularly the '2016 GPA Berlin Declaration').<br
/><br
/>C) Gezilla Destroys Isistanbul - 20:00<br
/><br
/>Serhat Soksal (Istambul/turquy) audiovisual performance - Following up on the idea of ‘altered.states’ – a geopolitics spectralized as much by sensory overload/dispossession, as by the re-location of power in the post-democratic/-digital era – ”GEZILLA DESTROYS ISISTANBUL” will re-render what is – or: was – referred to as ‘Europe’, ‘Eurottoman’, ‘Euronattoman’. Out-performing exoticism and choosing its own reference markers it will likewise engage the Golden Age Global Hologram Doctrine, ISIStanbul (TISAsistanbul), Anxt Hase States as it will feature modern isolation tanks as part of the new inventory of Hardcore Ultra Modernism.<br
/><br
/><br
/><b>3 - IMMERSIVE PROCESS - TECHNOSHAMANISM RITUAL</b> 21:00<br

/><br
/><b>Gil Fuser</b>&nbsp;<br
/>Six years ago I decided to dedicate my time doing and studying art. Since then I made animations, electronic music, poetry and stencil, among other projects, including graphic design. About two years ago I started to explore&nbsp; the possibilities of physical computing to mix the analog (real?) and the digital (virtual?) worlds. The interactive objects (e.g. instruments) interest me as a way to enable the re-signification of what is now taken for granted, finding new meanings and new ways of perceiving the world. At the same time it makes possible to enable the empowerment and the expansion of expression skills of anyone without requiring necessarily an artistic background.<br

Through the construction of experimental situations (within process-driven performance, laboratories, walks and workshops), material art works and texts, Howse explores the links between substance or materials and execution or protocol, excavating issues of visibility and of hiding within the world. For the last ten years he has collaborated on numerous open-laboratory style projects and performed, published, lectured and exhibited diversely. He is equally the creator of the skin-driven audio divination module, a.k.a. The Dark Interpreter. [1]<br
