<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>The GPA wants to convene actors and experts engaged in the process of opening ports and evaluating the needs and viability of closed ports. Acknowledging a critical moment for port authorities worldwide at a new global juncture (see GPA-declaration ‘GPA 2016: ‘the culture comes from the ports’ – re-phrasing the IOPS!’), the GPA will be consulting on a set of revised frameworks and certification standards for evaluating the continued use(-value) of ports globally for open forms of human interaction, extending to interspecies and interplanetary endeavours. GPA will also provide its own assets and expertise, channeling a long tradition of critical port governance on a global scale to the Berlin encounter, the first in the new phase of GPA´s 7th “evolution campaign” around the cultural structure of global ports.
<br>
To achieve an exchange that all existing port authorities are benefiting from in mutual exchange and consultation, the GPA has set up a temporary open.port in Berlin at Schillerpalais, close to the port of Tempelhof, the heritage airport site and current ground for different, even conflicting aspirations to re-port.
<br>
Alongside the open.port effort the GPA is collaborating with Transmediale to exchange expertise on new techniques and skillful technologies to open up and develop post-digital spaces with the on the ground interests of strategical Berlin port.</p>
